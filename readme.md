# Trello for Chrome

This is a small extension written to try out TypeScript and so I can create some cards directly from Chrome.

## How do I get it?

0. Check out the [live version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromello-for-trello/fconmkoajclilefnnpmfkcpfbicnppkj?hl=en)

1.  Clone [this repository](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v3ery2ynylo674s/TrelloForChrome.zip) somewhere where you won't lose it.
*  In chrome, go to ``chrome://extensions/``
*  Tick the *Developer mode* in the top right
*  Go to *Load unpacked extension* and point it at the directory where you extracted from the top file.
*  Give it access to your Trello.
*  The first time you open it, it may take a little while to get your boards.
*  Create some cards.
*  [Setup a keyboard shortcut](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/08/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-chrome.html) so you can do it super fast!
